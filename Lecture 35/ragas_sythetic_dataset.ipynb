At GitLab it is required to be inclusive.\\n\\nBeing an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating.\\n\\nThis ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally.\\n\\nSkills and Behaviors of allies\\n\\nTo be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit.\\n\\nActive listening\\n\\nNeutral and nonjudgmental.\\n\\nPatient (periods of silence are not \"filled\")\\n\\nVerbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring)\\n\\nAsking questions.\\n\\nReflecting back what is said.\\n\\nAsking for clarification.\\n\\nSummarizing.\\n\\nEmpathy & Emotional Intelligence\\n\\nAn example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden.\\n\\nActive learning about other experiences\\n\\nYou go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened.\\n\\nThis could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance.\\n\\nHumility\\n\\nNon-defensive\\n\\nWillingness to take on feedback\\n\\nYou aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally.\\n\\nExample of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience.\\n\\nCourage\\n\\nComfortable getting uncomfortable\\n\\nSpeak up where others don\\'t or can\\'t\\n\\nThe empathy example is also a good example of this.\\n\\nSelf-awareness\\n\\nOwn and use your privilege\\n\\nThis could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting?\\n\\nAction orientated\\n\\nYou see something, you say something\\n\\nThe example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives.\\n\\nIn a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation:\\n\\n\"I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you.\"\\n\\n\"I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language\"\\n\\nWhat it means to be an ally\\n\\nTake on the struggle as your own\\n\\nStand up, even when you feel uncomfortable\\n\\nTransfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it\\n\\nAcknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you\\n\\nConcepts & Terms\\n\\nPrivilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all\\n\\nOppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges\\n\\nAlly: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege\\n\\nPower: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges\\n\\nMarginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status. In a workplace setting, employees could be treated as invisible, as if they aren\\'t there or their skills or talents are unwelcome or unnecessary\\n\\nPerformative allyship: referring to allyship that is done to increase a person\\'s social capital rather than because of a person\\'s devotion to a cause. For example some people used #metoo during the Me Too movement, without actually bringing more awareness or trying to effect change.\\n\\nTips on being an ally\\n\\nIdentifying your power and privilege helps you act as an ally more effectively\\n\\nFollow and support those as much as possible from marginalized groups\\n\\nWhen you make a mistake, apologize, correct yourself, and move on\\n\\nAllies spend time educating themselves and use the knowledge to help\\n\\nAllies take the time to think and analyze the situation\\n\\nAllies try to understand Perception vs. Reality\\n\\nAllies don’t stop with their power they also leverage others powers of authority\\n\\nSee our Ally Resources Page for more resources on being an ally.\\n\\nAllyship & Empathy\\n\\nBeing an Ally Requires Empathy\\n\\n{{< youtube \"1Evwgu369Jw\" >}}\\n\\nResponding with Empathy\\n\\nWhat to say, when you don’t know what to say:\\n\\nAcknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.”\\n\\nShare how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.”\\n\\nShow Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.”\\n\\nShow Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?”\\n\\nBe Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.”\\n\\nBe Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.”\\n\\nBoot and Sandal Methophor\\n\\nImagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react?\\n\\nProblems with common responses to mistakes become obvious:\\n\\nCentering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!”\\n\\nDenial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.”\\n\\nDerailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?”\\n\\nRefusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!”\\n\\nTone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.”\\n\\nDenial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.”\\n\\nVictim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!”\\n\\nWithdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.”\\n\\nInstead, you would respond with the following:\\n\\nCenter the impacted: “Are you okay?”\\n\\nListen to their response and learn.\\n\\nApologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!”\\n\\nStop the instance: move your foot\\n\\nStop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!\\n\\nImprove allyship skills by following the three C\\'s\\n\\nConsciousness\\n\\nCourage\\n\\nCompassion\\n\\nHow diversity shows up on teams\\n\\nImage\\n\\nAreas you can show allyship\\n\\nRecruiting & Hiring\\n\\nSourcing\\n\\nInterviewing\\n\\nCompensation\\n\\nGuidance & Support\\n\\nHelping through challenges\\n\\nListening and empathizing\\n\\nProviding perspective\\n\\nMentorship\\n\\nDifficult Conversations\\n\\nPerformance conversations\\n\\nOngoing feedback\\n\\nGrowth & Career Development\\n\\nCareer planning\\n\\nSkill development\\n\\nMentorship and sponsorship\\n\\nExamples of Allyship at GitLab\\n\\nTBC\\n\\nAlly Lab Learning Group\\n\\n{{< youtube \"dPywm-j1iic\" >}}\\n\\nThe Ally Lab Learning Group is an initiative to learn to become or be a better ally within a collaborative group of peers who are seeking the same aim of allyship growth.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_Docs_Markdown\\\\building-diversity-and-inclusion.md'}, page_content='title: \"Building an Inclusive Remote Culture\" description: \"We are passionate about all remote working and enabling an inclusive work environment.\"\\n\\nWe are passionate about all remote working and enabling an inclusive work environment. There isn\\'t one big activity we can take to accomplish this. Instead, it is a mix of numerous activities and behaviors combined to enable our team members to feel they belong in GitLab.\\n\\nThose activities and behaviors include:\\n\\nDIB Events\\n\\nDIB Advisory Group\\n\\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging TMRGs - Team Member Resource Groups\\n\\nOur Values\\n\\nFamily and Friends first, Work second\\n\\nInclusive language and pronouns\\n\\nParental leave\\n\\nAsynchronous communication and workflows\\n\\nTips for Companies\\n\\nDefining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\\n\\nA great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab\\'s Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles.\\n\\nIn other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don\\'t create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain.\\n\\nEvaluating the company\\'s current DIB landscape\\n\\nConsider what you are already doing in this space.\\n\\nWhat is the current feedback?\\n\\nWhat are team members saying with company engagement surveys?\\n\\nWhat are the goals you are wanting to achieve?\\n\\nWhat are the metrics saying?\\n\\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey\\n\\nA company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members\\' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results.\\n\\nNaming this body of work\\n\\nAlthough Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc.\\n\\nDeveloping a mission statement\\n\\nWhen creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision.\\n\\nCreating TMRGs\\n\\nIn general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider:\\n\\nCreating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company\\n\\nNaming of each TMRG\\n\\nRoles within each TMRG\\n\\nAligning to company strategy\\n\\nCreating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics\\n\\nCreating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group\\n\\nConsider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global \"All Call\" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide \"why\" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be:\\n\\nDIB Advisory group guidelines\\n\\nAppointing an Executive sponsor from the company\\n\\nDesignating leads of the group\\n\\nDeciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members\\n\\nMore to come\\n\\nDIB Initiatives\\n\\nDIB Awards for Recognition\\n\\nDIB Surveys\\n\\nDIB Framework Inclusive Benefits\\n\\nTips for Managers\\n\\nSet aside time to show up for planned DIB events\\n\\nYou may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: \"I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?\"\\n\\nIncorporate DIB into your team meetings\\n\\nConnecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members).\\n\\nEncourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up\\n\\nDon’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader.\\n\\nConnect with your team members\\n\\nTo help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions.\\n\\nConsiderations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation. Being considerate of dietary restrictions when choosing food options for Contribute or other local gatherings. Acknowledging birthdays, recalling personal things that might have been mentioned in past calls such as moving to a new home, an ill family member or team member, and following up authentically.\\n\\nFor more information see our Inclusive Language.\\n\\nAsk employees what pronouns they use\\n\\nPronouns are a large piece of a person\\'s identity and are often used to communicate a person’s gender, which is why it is so important to get it right. Asking for a person\\'s pronouns and using those pronouns consistently shows that you respect their identity, but it also helps to create a more welcoming, safe, and supportive environment where people can feel comfortable being themselves. This is a change that goes a long way to foster inclusion.\\n\\nBe mindful of the times of your meetings\\n\\nIt\\'s important to consider global times and alternating meetings to accommodate regions. Be mindful of families, commitments, observances, holidays, and meeting times that may be out of team members\\' working hours. Every meeting time won\\'t be perfect for everyone (which is why all meetings have an agenda), but making a conscious effort to alternate times is to ensure the same people aren\\'t being excluded. For more, view our Inclusive Meetings operating principle.\\n\\nBe a Role Model\\n\\nAs a manager, you are in a unique position to model good DIB practices for the rest of your team. Be authentic, own up to mistakes, and commit to doing better next time. Don’t dwell on it. Set a good example by admitting that you make mistakes and invite people to help you and each other by speaking up in accordance with our feedback guidelines. By holding each other accountable, we get better as a team.\\n\\nTips for Team Members\\n\\nSchedule a Coffee Chat with a Team Member\\n\\nUnderstanding GitLab is fully remote, there is an opportunity to get to know team members beyond your geographical location as well as outside of your division. This provides an opportunity to:\\n\\nlearn more about other cultures and work divisions\\n\\ncultivate better global communication\\n\\nmake progress toward building an inclusive environment\\n\\nCoffee chats are suggested during onboarding but you don\\'t need to stop there. It is recommended to continue this action whenever you would like to. Please take a look at our GitLab team page and feel free to select someone for a coffee chat!\\n\\nHold Each Other Accountable\\n\\nHold each other accountable and speak up when someone uses non-inclusive language. We should also celebrate when we are inclusive, and strive to support each other every day.\\n\\nAvoid Identity Assumption Statements\\n\\nIdentity is a personal thing. Looks or names can imply diverse attributes, but they are not perfect identity indicators. Avoid making statements about someone\\'s perceived race, gender, age, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. When people are typecast or feel misunderstood, they are less likely to feel that they belong.\\n\\nTip to Uncover Unconscious Bias\\n\\nWhen you are dealing with a specific situation, you can mentally flip the situation around and see how that feels. For example, flip it from a woman to a man, and if it feels off then you might have a bias. By putting ourselves in someone else\\'s shoes, we can better understand their point of view and be more supportive.\\n\\nMore to come\\n\\nConsider joining a TMRG (Team Member Resource Group)\\n\\nSupport others as an Ally\\n\\nReview the Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging page'),\n",

If you would like to see the history of goals going further back, you can view the evolution of the page in GitLab.\\n\\nCurrent Goals\\n\\nGeographic Diversity (Team Member representation outside of NORAM)\\n\\nWe do not currently have a company wide goal for Geographic Diversity and this will remain in place for FY\\'23. Instead we will focus on increasing Director+ representation outside of the United States as team member representation is currently outpacing leadership representation. It would not prove advantageous to take a goal to contiue to increase team members external to the United States without first focusing on increasing our leadership population external to the United States. In FY24, we will reevaluate the need for director level+ representation goals outside of the United States.\\n\\nProblem Statement & Data:\\n\\nWhat is a timeline to create a US leadership KPI and/or OKR?\\n\\nHypothesis:\\n\\nHiring occurs predominantly in US.\\n\\nLeadership is predominantly US Centric\\n\\nWe are not currently hiring in enough countries\\n\\nData:\\n\\nEngineering Data: Representation in US vs. External to US\\n\\nBreakdown by levels showed that there are proportionate # of TMs at both the IC and Manager levels when comparing US to Non-US representation.\\n\\nEngineering: US: 30.2% Non-US: 69.8%\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nBased on the data provided on both the current breakdown of TMs, levels and regions for Engineering, we do not recommend creating an additional goal around increased geographic representation.\\n\\nGlobal Representation of URGs\\n\\nThese breakouts are currently found here\\n\\nPast Goals\\n\\nCurrently no past goals to attribute here\\n\\n**Due to data and or legal limitations, this is not an exhaustive list of all of our underrepresented groups.

The pilot program was designed to create pathways for Black Team Members to progress effectively at GitLab. We have since extended this program to promote pathways for all Sales team members to progress at GitLab.\\n\\nMentorship vs Sponsorship\\n\\nHarvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.”\\n\\nMentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone\\'s personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1\\'s at GitLab are driven by direct reports.\\n\\nSponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential.\\n\\nRole of a Sponsor at GitLab\\n\\nA Sponsor is someone who has power and influence at GitLab and will use that power to advocate, elevate and impact a team members opportunities and career progression at GitLab.\\n\\nA sponsor at GitLab is:\\n\\nA Senior Leader at a minimum job grade 10+ and is not the sponsees direct manager.\\n\\nThe senior leader should be a People Manager or Manager of Managers\\n\\nMust have been at GitLab for 6+ months\\n\\nBe able to commit to a 9 month sponsorship program which will include\\n\\nSponsor Training\\n\\nKick-off calls\\n\\nBi-weekly 1-1 with Sponsee\\n\\nBe able to fully commit and be held accountable for their role within the Sponsorship Program\\n\\nAs a Sponsor you should be:\\n\\nBe open and honest\\n\\nListen and Learn\\n\\nLean into discomfort in areas not familiar to you (e.g. cultural differences)\\n\\nTake risks with the relationship\\n\\nAdvocate for your sponsee with intent\\n\\nGive feedback as appropriate\\n\\nBe intentional in building the relationship\\n\\nA sponsor will:\\n\\nUse their influence and power to advocate for the sponsee potential for career advancement\\n\\nUse their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee amongst other Senior Leaders at GitLab\\n\\nUse their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee at GitLab\\n\\nProvide opportunities and space for risk-taking and growth\\n\\nProvide feedback on growth and skill development\\n\\nThe sponsorship relationship may not provide all the above but the sponsor should be willing and able to provide some of the opportunities above to the sponsor.\\n\\nRole of a Sponsee\\n\\nA Sponsee at GitLab will be (Pilot Program Only):\\n\\nBe performing in your role in accordance with your managers expectations, which take into account performance exercises such as 9 box and not on a Performance Improvement Plan\\n\\nBe a part of the underrepresented group the sponsorship program is targeted at.\\n\\nBe able to commit to 9 months within the program\\n\\nWilling to commit to the overall expectations of the program as outlined throughout the handbook page\\n\\nAs a Sponsee you should be:\\n\\nBe able to lead the relationship with your sponsor\\n\\nBe able Take risks with the relationship—trust is a vital part of the relationship\\n\\nBe able to do the work required based on feedback received and requirements for success\\n\\nBe able to request and give feedback as appropriate\\n\\nBe able to take personal responsibility for your career and be empowered to ask for what you need\\n\\nA Sponsee will:\\n\\nMaintain or exceed their performance record\\n\\nMaintain trust & confidentiality in the relationship\\n\\nAssist the sponsor in insights to the business and challenging perceived norms\\n\\nBe an ambassador for our CREDIT Values\\n\\nHave aspirational goals for career development; within leadership or as a senior IC\\n\\nHave a growth mindset and will be able to continually learn\\n\\nHave the ability to take on special projects which will impact their growth\\n\\nMakes themselves available for opportunities and stretch assignments\\n\\nConsistently performing at or above the performance bar\\n\\nRole of Sponsees Manager\\n\\nThe manager will support the team member in ensuring that have a Individual Growth Plan (IGP)\\n\\nAs well reassess the IGP at regular intervals during the sponsorship program\\n\\nThe manager will regularly check in on the progress of the Sponsorship Program with their report\\n\\nThe manager will regularly report on the success of the program to the leadership advocates of the program\\n\\nParticipate in a manager of sponsees session\\n\\nSponsorship Program\\n\\nThe program will last 6 months and the Sponsor & Sponsee will be the same person throughout the program.\\n\\nThe program will consist of:\\n\\nAn Individual Growth Plan is created in conjunction with your direct manager. The sponsor will add further suggestions throughout the program\\n\\n1-1 conversation in a cadence agreed upon by the participants.\\n\\nWe suggest a minimum of bi-weekly.\\n\\nSpecial projects & Sponsorship activities may mean cadence changes\\n\\nQuarterly All-Hands\\n\\nThis will reinforce the ideals of the sponsorship program and ensure that the relationship is progressing through the phases.\\n\\nIndividual Quarterly Feedback with DIB Team\\n\\nEnd of Program session with Sponsor\\n\\nComplete Next Step Documentation with Sponsor & Direct Manager to ensure progression continues\\n\\nSponsor Sponsee Matching:\\n\\nA sponsor should be at least two job grades higher than the sponsee\\n\\nA sponsor and sponsee should be in a timezone that is practical to have 1-1s. Special projects etc can follow asynchronous principles\\n\\nIf possible Sponsor should align with the career development plan of the sponsee\\n\\nWhat does a successful sponsorship look like?\\n\\nBuild\\n\\nTake the time to build a solid relationship with each other. This will be particularly important if you have no previous direct working relationship and can often take some time to cultivate. It is very important to build the relationship first before moving into authentic sponsorship.\\n\\nSuggested Actions:\\n\\nCommit to regular 1-1s\\n\\nUnderstand the sponsees career development plan\\n\\nSet goals and expectations early\\n\\nDevelop\\n\\nYou have taken the time to build a relationship with each other, the next step is to develop that relationship by becoming action & capability focussed. In this step the sponsor will help guide the sponsee on areas of improvement in skills & capabilities. The sponsee is responsible for acting on feedback and being intentional about displaying these improvements to the sponsor.\\n\\nSuggested Actions:\\n\\nFind and seek opportunities for the sponsor to observe the sponsees improvement areas\\n\\nSponsee invites Sponsor to a team meeting where they are presenting\\n\\nSponsor invites sponsee to a working group\\n\\nCommit\\n\\nThis is where both parties agree to move forward with the next step, which is sponsorship and advocating for the sponsee. This can take many forms, such as; a formal discussion, the sponsor outlining actions to the sponsee or at the sponsees request. This is an opportunity to provide feedback, any uncertainties and to reestablish career development goals.\\n\\nSuggested Actions:\\n\\nParticipate in feedback session with sponsee\\n\\nAdvocate\\n\\nNow that a commitment has been made and the sponsor is satisfied that the sponsee is ready for the next step. The sponsor actively and intentionally advocates for sponsees continued career development and advancement at GitLab.\\n\\nGoals & Benefits of Sponsorship Program\\n\\nGoals:\\n\\nThe goal of this program is to provide team members from underrepresented groups opportunities to have more visibility at GitLab. We are starting with the Black team member population in sales as they are very underrepresented in all areas of leadership. The goal is that programs like this will help redress the imbalance and ensure we are moving towards a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n\\nSponsor:\\n\\nExposure to a diverse set of team members at GitLab, increasing their ability to lead diverse teams\\n\\nExposure to new ideas and be challenged on the status quo\\n\\nIntentional talent management & succession planning\\n\\nBetter understanding of the challenges of team members from underrepresented groups\\n\\nSponsee:\\n\\nIncreased exposure to GitLab and visibility to senior leaders at GitLab\\n\\nAccess to feedback from a senior leader\\n\\nAbility to develop skills and capabilities\\n\\nIncreased control over your career development plan\\n\\nGitLab:\\n\\nA more diverse team at leadership team\\n\\nIncreased retention of team members\\n\\nAttraction of underrepresented groups to GitLab\\n\\nTeam members more motivated to maintain performance levels\\n\\nMeasurables\\n\\nStart, Mid and End of the program - Satisfaction score from both Sponsor and Sponsee\\n\\nCareer Advancement Rate within twelve months of the program\\n\\nPilot Project Plan\\n\\nPhase 1:\\n\\nDevelop training materials for Sponsors & Sponsees => 0%\\n\\nDevelop program materials => 0%\\n\\nSponsorship 1-1 guide => 0%\\n\\nNext Steps Doc - for End of Program => 0%\\n\\nIdentify first cohort of sponsees amongst Team Members in Sales => 0%\\n\\nWhat criteria they have for a sponsor => 0%\\n\\nIdentify first cohort of sponsors with the Sales Org => 0%\\n\\nWhat expertise they are willing to provide and opportunities they can provide => 0%\\n\\nMatchmaking of Sponsors & Sponsee => 0%\\n\\nComplete => => 0%\\n\\nPhase 2:\\n\\nConduct Kick-Off call to present the program => 0%\\n\\nConduct Sponsorship Training => 0%\\n\\nRelease Sponsorship Matches => 0%\\n\\nConduct Pre-Start AMA => 0%\\n\\nPhase 3:\\n\\nBegin the Sponsorship Program => 0%\\n\\nQuarterly check in call - Group => 0%\\n\\nQuarterly feedback individual check in => 0%\\n\\nNext Steps Doc completion => 0%\\n\\nEnd Program => 0%\\n\\nPhase 4:\\n\\nRetrospective on Program Success/Improvements => 0%\\n\\nFinal feedback from Participants => 0%\\n\\nProvide iteration recommendations => 0%'),\n",
